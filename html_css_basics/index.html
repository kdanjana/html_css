                HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design web
                pages on the internet.
                HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages
                and Markup language defines the text document within the tag.

            <h2> CSS basics</h2>
            <p>
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that allows you to define style definitions
                for your HTML document. These definitions will be picked up by the browser and
                control how the content will be displayed (e.g. that some text is red, which font size
                it should have etc.).CSS is a rule-based language that defines the rules to design a particular element
                or a group of elements on your web page.
                Where HTML defines the structure and meaning of your content (and of course also
                helps with displaying the content in the first place - e.g. with the <img> element),
                CSS is used to then present the content exactly how you want to present it. It adds
                no meaning or annotation - it's really just about how things look.
                If oyu want to change text colors, background colors, sizes, spacings, distances,
                borders, shadows, positions and all these things, you need CSS.
                CSS has 3 ways to style your HTML:
            </p>
            <ul class="section_main_lists">
                <li><strong>Inline: </strong> Add styles directly to HTML elements (limited use).</li>
                <li><strong>Internal: </strong>Put styles inside the HTML file in a style tag.</li>
                <li><strong>
                        External:</strong> Create a separate CSS file (.css) and link it to your HTML.</li>
            </ul>
